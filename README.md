# unity_driller
Virtual environment to simulate an oil driller's cabin and controls.

# Purpose
Built as part of the 2015 ConocoPhillips Innovation Challenge, which was a 2-day competition among 4 teams to build solutions to various problems. This project attempts to recreate an oil-driller's rig in such a way that they could control the rig remotely while ensuring the safety of on-site workers. Project pipes in additional data from XML files (used as mock drill data) and the Weather Underground API.

# Outcome
This project took first place, a $10,000 prize. Teammembers learned the value of accessibility and safety features when programming for work applications in the real world. They also got the opportunity to explore use of Unity 3-D, the Oculus Rift, and Microsoft Kinect and combine these tools to discover new ways to visualize data.
